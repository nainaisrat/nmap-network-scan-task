## What I Did
- Used Kali Linux, which comes with Nmap pre-installed.
- Found my local IP range.

- Noted down the IP addresses and open ports found.
- (Optional) Used Wireshark to analyze packets.
- Researched what services run on the open ports.
- Identified potential security risks.

## What I Learned

- How to identify open ports and understand their risks.
- Basics of network reconnaissance and network service exposure.
